# pymodoro
A simple pomodoro implementation in Python

It's goal is to let one focus on their tasks and ask them to take breaks of 5 minutes in between tasks.
On macOS, the app uses NSSpeechSynthesizer to provide its responses and requests in voice to the user.

The app relies on venv to have the needed libraries.
These libraries are described in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ralchev/pymodoro/blob/master/requirements.txt).
